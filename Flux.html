                    Flux is 2-4 player local co-op party game in which you play as a transcendent crystal being with the
                    power to telepathically move objects around you. The player has to use his telepathic powers to lift
                    and throw objects in the arena to the other players and be the last man standing. The player has the
                    ability to stop any incoming threats by timing his powers, giving the objects extra speed on his
                    next throw.
                    This project was made in 48 hours for the 2018 Global Game Jam. </p>

                    <i>This description is the one from Wisp Renderer and serves as a place holder, A correct one will be writen Sunday July 7th.</i> I started working on this project since I wanted to improve my skill as a graphics programmer and was looking forward to a tech focused project. In the initial stages of the project I've been working on implementing the basics of a PBR pipeline into our deferred rasterized renderer. During this time I've also worked on some general engine maintenance to improve the quality of life during future development. Later on I started working on implementing Raytraced Ambient Occlusion during which my understanding of both DirectX 12 increased significantly. In the final stages of the project I've implemented crash logging and switched back and forth iterating on the Ambient Occlusion render task and creating an editor for the graphics settings to tweak the render tasks during run time.            </p>
